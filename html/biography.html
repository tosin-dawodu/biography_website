      <div id="biography">
        <p id="bio-brief">
          Ezekiel Olagbenga Ayodeji Dawodu was born on 31st March 1947 to the
          families of <b>Late Pa Christopher Olatunde Dawodu</b> , a foremost
          Timber Technologist of note from Ijebu Igbo, Ogun State and
          <b>Sussanah Funsoh Campbell</b>, the daughter of church Patriarch,
          Late J.G. Campbell, founder of the West African Episcopal Church with
          the headquarter at 76, Adeniji Adele Road, Lagos.
        </p>

        <b>Education</b>
        <p>
          For his elementary education, he attended Ade Oshodi Elementary School
          situated on Tapa Street, Lagos from 1952 - 1958 and on completion,
          proceeded to Muslim High School Sagamu, Ogun State but completed his
          secondary education at Epe Divisional Grammar School Epe, Ogun State
          where he sat for his WASCE and was successful.
        </p>

        <b>Work Career </b>
        <p>
          On completion of his secondary education, he was employed as a Clerk
          with the Federal Civil Service in 1967 in the Accounts department at
          the Ministry of Works headquarters on Race Course Lagos. His
          handwriting got a lot of approbation from all who worked closely with
          him. His mastery of the art of calligraphy drew admiration from his
          bosses and he was always asked to prepare the presentation of
          financial reports. This was the era when PowerPoint presentation was
          not in vogue. Added to this, he was a very conscientious and dedicated
          civil servant and this earned him respect from all; thus his career
          progressed. I can recall vividly that one of his bosses requested that
          he be transferred with him to AFDP - Armed Forces Development Project,
          an arm of the Federal Government that administered Armed Forces
          Projects. He served in the Federal Ministry of Agriculture, there, he
          was posted to the Federal Ministry of Internal Affairs, this
          particular ministry made him travel nationwide to different parts of
          Nigeria for auditing. His last assignment as a civil servant ended in
          the Federal Ministry of Education as the deputy chief auditing
          officer. Later on in life, he acquired the name Egerton and to his
          admirers he fondly address himself as Egerton Daw then EDA and later
          EDAC which he finally used as his business name EDAC Trades.
        </p>

        <b>Training</b>
        <p>
          At a stage in his career, he was sent on a long-term course to ASCON
          in Badagry, the then-popular Civil Service University of repute and on
          his return, he was promoted to higher ranks and on and on, and he
          became an Assistant Director. His last posting was to Abuja before he
          finally retired honourably on completion of the statutory years in
          service
        </p>

        <b>Extra-Curricular Activities </b>
        <p>
          He was a lover of sports with his best in football. He was a very good
          and agile goalkeeper while in secondary school and even after. He kept
          the goal for his school and was even invited by the then Western
          Region to represent the region in a competition. He held sway also for
          Okepopo Boys and Girls Club Lagos, a clubhouse we both belonged.
        </p>

        <b>Retirement</b>
        <p>
          He moved with his younger children to Odoragunshin, Epe in 2010 to
          retire from the hustle and bustle of the central city. He was
          instantly adopted by the community as one of theirs. ‘Baba Alaja’ as
          he was fondly called was a gregarious man and enjoyed the company of
          many within the community and beyond. He played host to his friends
          and neighbours, especially on Easter and Christmas celebrations. He
          was a cheerful, generous and compassionate giver of note and he gave
          to those in need as the Lord provided for him. He was also a devout
          member of the Catholic faith up to his passing and played vital roles
          in the development of the church where he was once the vice-chairman
          of the Church Council. He did not die unsung, he is survived by
          children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren who are making their
          mark in their different callings; brothers, sisters and the entire
          family. "O death where is thy sting? O grave where is thy victory. But
          thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus
          Christ". May his gentle soul rest in peace.
