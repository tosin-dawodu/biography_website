            ever ready to accommodate, and never tired to help, no matter how
            small it may be. A man of time, very conscious of time, never
            nonsense father, and disciplinary. You were my angel since I lost my
            mother about 49 years ago, you were there for me me and my late
            brother when we were growing up, Though, there was a time of
            misunderstanding, yet everything was resolved amicably You stood by
            me through the thick and thin of life and being supportive in times

            Our similar taste in music. Our friendship. The way you called after
            2 days claiming you haven&#39;t spoken to me in a “very long time”.
            How we talked about what or not to eat. Our ever opposing views and
            debates on politics. Your constant refusal to allow anyone but me
            cut your nails. How you proofread my write-ups. How much you
            celebrated every milestone I have attained. How we ensured we spoke
            at the beginning of every examination I took so you could pray for
            me. How you made me select your caps for mass. How you video-called
            just so we could see ourselves. How you protected us all through the
            way. The values you imparted in me. <br />
            It feels unreal when I remember I can&#39;t call anymore to “gist”
            you. You were my spiritual blanket, your prayers gave me confidence
            in all my endeavours. You lived for us and I pray you&#39;re happy

            physically have you with me. I still find it hard to believe you are
            no more. I go through our WhatsApp messages waiting to see one of
            your early morning prayers or motivation. You never missed that. How
            you sit on your chair and welcome us with so much joy when we visit
            you at home. <i>“Ha Ha Ha, Iya Ibrahim, awon omo yin to de o”</i>.

            discriminated against anyone, either young or old. You were a really
            wise man daddy. You guided me through this journey of life and were
            always there to pick me up when I fell. Daddy, I would miss your
            constant calls and prayers. Till today, I crave to see an incoming
            call with “Daddy” on my screen but I guess that&#39;s never going to
            happen again. You were a lover of God, and it showed in your
            everyday life. You pushed us always to have a great relationship
            with God. And I&#39;m glad you did that. One of your most famous
            phrases: <i>“it pays to be good and it costs nothing”</i> is one
            I&#39;ve adopted and would live with me forever. <br />

            I feel so heartbroken writing this tribute at the passing away of
            Baba Dawodu. I had thought he would live far beyond ninety which
            would have been a befitting time to write. I have known Baba for
            well over seven years now. He was urbane, intelligent, considerate,
            dignified, honourable, sincere, considerate, grateful, contented and
            reasonable. He was indeed a proper gentleman. He was a good Catholic
            always wanting to do his own best to contribute to the progress of
            the Church especially in the C.M.O. He loved people and had a
            special love for his children. Having passed on, we pray that his
            dreams for his children will materialize. Baba Dawodu will be sorely
            missed by all of us at St. Peter&#39;s Catholic Church. May the Lord
            grant him eternal rest in His bosom.

            My big brother, Broda mi, as I always called him left us so
            suddenly. I am still finding it difficult to believe that he is no
            more with us. Broda mi was a generous, kind, protective, loving and
            caring person he always wants to be sure that everyone was fine.
            When I was planning my trip to Paris, France for my studies, he
            offered to pay for my flight ticket. He said " Taiye I will be
            honoured if you allow me to buy your flight ticket " I can still
            relive our walk from Race Course to CMS where the flight agent was
            located. A few months later he came to see me in Paris, on his way
            to London to make sure that I was settling in well. Many years
            later, he came to London to see me and my young family. That's the
            nature of the man I knew. Very protective and caring for his
            siblings. I will miss the philosophical discussions, chats and jokes
            that we often have. Broda me enjoyed life to the full. He would
            often take me on a drive in his orange-brown beetle. For me, in my
            late teens at the time, life was 'cool' and he contributed a lot to
            that period of my life when I was getting to understand the 'adult'
            world. What a BIG brother! <br />
            I want to thank him for the positive impact he had on me. Being with
            him and knowing him, has made me a better person. He thought me how
            to be positive even when things are not going as planned. His usual
            phrase to me was always 'aburo mi, à dàà, Kàmàdùpè. Always remain
            hopeful and grateful no matter what. Lastly, I want to say that his
            love, care and pride in his children was beyond reproach. Thank you
            so much for being part of our lives. You will be sorely missed.

            Pa Ezekiel Olagbenga Ayodeji Dawodu, You gave no one a last farewell
            nor ever said goodbye, you were gone before we knew it. But we will
            always draw strength and comfort from the scriptures: 1Thessalonians
            4: 13 - 14: "But we do not want you to be uninformed, brothers,
            about those who are asleep, that you may not grieve as others do who
            have no hope. For since we believe that Jesus died and rose again,
            even so, through Jesus, and will bring with him those who have
            fallen asleep. <br />
            You will forever live in our hearts, and we will always cherish
            every special moment of the special times we spent with you, these
            memories too beautiful to forget will always be remembered each time
            we look at our lovely nephew and nieces. We thank God you lived. As
            we lay you finally to rest today, we pray that God grants your soul
            eternal rest, Daddy.

            I remember those days when I used to be scared of coming over to his
            house because I wanted to see one of his children. He was after all
            a “retired military man”. But when I got to know him better, my
            fears turned to nothing but joy and pure love for I saw him more as
            a father than as a military man. He would oftentimes encourage me
            and invite me over to the house himself. He calls me his son and I
            call him "daddy". Pa Dawodu would send me daily quotes to motivate
            and kickstart my day. It got to a point I wasn't reading them
            anymore because they became so many. How lovely it would be to see
            more quotes from you, Sir, not minding how many they are. I had the
            opportunity to see Pa Dawodu for the last time in the month of
            November 2021. I was happy to be around a wonderful and
            healthy-looking man who told me he would celebrate his birthday
            soon. I loved how proud he was of his children. He is a father
            indeed. I'll miss you, daddy. Rest well.
